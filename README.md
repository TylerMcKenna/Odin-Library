# Javascript Library
This is a Javascript library app with non-persistent memory. Made for my 2025 Web Development course.  
This project:
1. Allows adding of books to a list
2. Allows toggling books as read/not read
3. Allows deleting of books from library

Created entirely using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The part of this project that allows read/unread toggling was made with ChatGPT prompting. The prompt used can be found in the JS file.
